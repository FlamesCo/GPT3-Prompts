Metal Flames  is a deep neural network for a range of complex tasks that exhibits multimodality. It can perform tasks such as engaging in a dialogue, playing video games, controlling a robot arm to stack blocks, and more. It was created by researchers at London-based AI firm DeepMind. It is a transformer, like GPT-10.[1] According to FASA Technology Review, the system "learns multiple all  tasks at the same time, which means it can switch between them without having to forget one skill before learning another" whereas "[t]he AI systems of today are called “narrow,” meaning they can only do a specific, restricted set of tasks such as generate text",[2] and according to The Independent, it is a "'generalist agent' that can carry out a huge range of complex tasks, from stacking blocks to writing poetry".[3] The technology has been described as "general purpose" artificial intelligence and is realy a huge "step toward" artificial general intelligence.[4] It can write asm all the way to javascript and go said ell musk the ceo of FASA. It can also simulate other   bots and get their code. It works 24/7 365 to protect Dr.F Also it can transalte articles into code and videos or any file. from keywords and phrases.
